# Getting Started with SMARKETS Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The Application consists of two pages - `TopEvents` and `EventDetails`.

`TopEvents1` - This page is the main page which shows the most popular events in the sports and football category. 

`EventDetails` - This page is rendered when we click on one of the popular events from TopEvents page. It shows the basic details about the Event. 
Wherever stats are present, it shows the stats. Otherwise it shows proper message if no events found or when some error occured. 

I have used `Allow CORS` extension on Chrome to bypass CORS issues. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test for two pages - TopEvents and EventDetails.
You can have a look at the tests in the folder - "src/tests/"




## Possible Improvements

- I can write this in typescript as well but due to time constraints was not able to. 
- Error scenarios can be handled in a better way. Can suggest better ways in a later discussions.
- I tried to keep UI as simple as possible. I can implement UI like Smarkets website if I devote more time to it. 
- I tried to implement the assignment according to whatever I could understand from the PDF shared with me for the problem statement. Pardon me if I did not implement something that was expected from me :)
